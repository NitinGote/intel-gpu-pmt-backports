# IntelÂ® Platform Monitoring Technology Backports

This repo holds backports of the pmt driver.

The driver is provided as a DKMS module targeting distinct
versions of various distros. Each backport is on a topic 
branch. Current support status is documented on the topic branch.

## Branching and tagging strategy

We will no longer update branches and add tags for specific operating systems. 
At the moment, the driver can be built for all supported operating systems from the branches listed below. 
For each branch there will be created corresponding release tag with the branch name suffix.

- main
  - SLES 15SP4
  - Ubuntu 20.04 (kernel 5.15)
  - Ubuntu 22.04 (kernel 5.17)
  - RHEL 8.6

- legacy
  - SLES 15SP3

## Dependencies
This driver is part of a collection of kernel mode drivers 
that together enable support for Intel graphics. The backports 
collection within https://github.com/intel-gpu includes:

  - [i915](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports) - The main graphics driver (includes a compatible DRM subsystem and dmabuf if necessary).
  - [cse](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-cse-backports) - Converged Security Engine
  - [pmt](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-pmt-backports) - Intel Platform Telemetry
  - [firmware](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-firmware) - Contains firmware required by i915.  

Each project is tagged consistently so when pulling these repos pull the same tag.

## How to generate the DKMS module

### Ubuntu
#### Install dependencies:

NOTE: replace linux-headers with headers specific to your kernel
as needed.

```
sudo apt install \
    dkms \
    make \
    linux-headers-5.14.0-1034-oem
```

#### Create debian package:
```
export OS_TYPE=ubuntu_20.04
BUILD_VERSION=1 make -f Makefile.dkms dkmsdeb-pkg
```

#### Install dkms deb package:

```
sudo dpkg -i intel-platform-pmt-dkms-*.deb
```

### SLES 

#### Install dependencies:

```
sudo zypper install \
   dkms \
   make \
   linux-glibc-devel \
   lsb-release \
   rpm-build
```

#### Build and install dkms package
```
export OS_TYPE=sles
export OS_VERSION=15sp4
BUILD_VERSION=1 make -f Makefile.dkms dkmsrpm-pkg
```

The resulting rpm package will be located in:
/usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/

Install with:

```
sudo zypper install --allow-unsigned-rpm \
    /usr/src/packages/RPMS/x86_64/intel-platform-pmt-dkms-*.rpm
```

### RHEL

#### Install dependencies:

Install packages

```
sudo dnf install \
   git \
   kernel-headers \
   make \
   rpm-build
```

Install dkms subsystem support:

```
git clone https://github.com/dell/dkms dkms
cd dkms
make install-redhat
```

#### Build and install dkms package
```
export OS_TYPE=rhel_8
export OS_VERSION="8.6"
BUILD_VERSION=1 make -f Makefile.dkms dkmsrpm-pkg
```

The rpm package will be placed in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64.
For example:

```
/home/user/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/intel-platform-pmt-dkms-2022.7-1.x86_64.rpm
```

To install, run:

```
cp $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm .
sudo dnf install intel-platform-pmt-dkms*.rpm
```

## How to generate the binary package

### SLES 15SP4

#### Install dependencies:

```
sudo zypper install \
   make \
   linux-glibc-devel \
   lsb-release \
   rpm-build
```

#### Build and install dkms package
```
export OS_TYPE=sles
export OS_VERSION=15sp4
make -f Makefile.dkms BUILD_VERSION=1 binrpm-pkg
```

The rpm package will be placed in $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/.
For example:

```
/home/user/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/intel-platform-vsec-kmp-default-2022.46.1_k5.14.21_150400.24.21-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Install with:

```
cp $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/intel-platform-vsec*.rpm .
sudo rpm -ivh intel-platform-vsec*.rpm
```
